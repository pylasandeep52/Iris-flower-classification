# Iris-flower-classification
I designed iris flower classification  using machine learning in python. In this model mainly we are using libraries called  Numpy,  Matplotlib , Seaborn ,Pandas, Scikit-learn .
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
Support vector machine: A support vector machine (also known as a support vector network) is a supervised machine learning algorithm that analyzes data for classification and regression. SVMs are one of the most robust classifications methods.

# Steps to classify Iris Flower:
1. Load the data
2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
3. Model training.
4. Model Evaluation.
5. Testing the model.

   In this project, we learned to train our own supervised machine learning model using Iris Flower Classification Project with Machine Learning. Through this project, we learned about machine learning, data analysis, data visualization, model creation, etc.
